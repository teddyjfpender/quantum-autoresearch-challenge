# QROAM angle words: sa-toff imchxL, keep 9+9, blocks 5/2

Recorded before the challenge opened and part of its starting board. This note is generated from
the circuit's build parameters and its validation run; it states facts, not a research narrative.

## What it is

Track `reiher`, architecture `qroam-word` (QROAM angle words).

The selected network stays in binary and all of its angles are fetched at once by a table lookup into a wide data register. There is no unary or one-hot copy of the index; the qubit peak is set by the angle word.

## Build

| Knob | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `FEMOCO_WALK_ARCH` | `sa-toff` |
| `FEMOCO_SA_MU_O` | `9` |
| `FEMOCO_SA_MU_I` | `9` |
| `FEMOCO_SA_INNER_A` | `5` |
| `FEMOCO_SA_OUTER_A` | `2` |
| `FEMOCO_SA_TWEAKS` | `imchxL` |

The track sets `FEMOCO_WALK_SPEC`. For the `sa-toff` builder, each letter of the lever string is
documented in `src/walk/sa_low/README.md`, section 6. The circuit is also pinned byte for byte as
`est_toffl5_r` in `tests/sa_circuits/list.rs`; the pin was written as `toff_a("imchxL", 5)`.

## Result

| Toffolis per step | Peak qubits | Score (Toffolis x qubits) | Lanes | Engines |

| 9312.000 | 1044 | 9721728.000 | 524288 | `reference-4096+sliced-524288` |

Validated by the judge pipeline: a screen on the reference engine and a full run on the sliced
engine, both on lanes seeded by the ledger key, with no engine fallback.
